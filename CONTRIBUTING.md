For developers,

Thank you for taking your time for Harvester. Your contribution is always welcome but excepting fixing typos or obvious defects, we would strongly encourage you to create a development branch for your trial to prevent making the trunk corrupt.

We are not willing to enforce you to follow any restrict rule but it might be a good idea to introduce you a naming convention for creating a development branch: a development branch shall have a prefix ``_dev`` with your name and terminate it with a simple and obvious title. So it would look like ``_dev_kznr_issue_123`` or ``_dev_kznr_extending_foo``; the former one is preferred because we can quickly jump to the issue page just taking a look at the issue number.

Once you completed the work on your branch, please give us a pull request.

Thank you again for your contribution. We proud of you as a person who creates something meaningful for the human beings.

Best regards,
Kazunari
