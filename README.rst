About Harvester
###############

Harvester was created to be a friendly image acquisition library for all people who those want to learn computer/machine vision. Technically speaking, Harvester is a Python library which is responsible for the following tasks:

* Image acquisition
* Device manipulation
* Image data visualization (optional)

Harvester consumes image acquisition libraries, so-called GenTL Producers. If you have an officially certified GenTL Producer and GenICam compliant machine vision cameras, then Harvester supplies you the acquired image data as `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ array to make your image processing task productive.

You can freely use, modify, distribute Harvester under `Apache License-2.0 <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_ without worrying about the use of your software: personal, internal or commercial.

Currently, Harvester is being developed by the motivated contributors from all over the world.

***********************
Where is the name from?
***********************

Harvester's name was coming from the great Flemish painter, Pieter Bruegel the Elder's painting so-called "The Harvesters". Harvesters harvest a crop every season that has been fully grown and the harvested crop is passed to the consumers. On the other hand, image acquisition libraries acquire images as their crop and the images are passed to the following processes. We found the similarity between them and decided to name our library Harvester.

Apart from anything else, we love its peaceful and friendly name. We hope you also like it ;-)

You might be able to directly download one at their website but please note that perhaps some of them could require you to register your information to get one. In addition, some GenTL Producers might block you to connect other competitors' cameras.

###########
Terminology
###########

Before start talking about the detail, let's take a look at some important terminologies that frequently appear in this document. These terminologies are listed as follows:

* **The GenApi-Python Binding**: A Python module that communicates with the GenICam reference implementation.

* **A GenTL Producer**: A library that has C interface and offers consumers a way to communicate with cameras over physical transport layer dependent technology hiding the detail from the consumer.

* **The GenTL-Python Binding**: A Python module that communicates with GenTL Producers.

* **Harvester**: A Python module that consists of Harvester Core and Harvester GUI.

* **Harvester Core**: A part of Harvester that works as an image acquisition engine.

* **Harvester GUI**: A part of Harvester that works as a graphical user interface of Harvester Core.

* **A GenICam compliant device**: It's typically a camera. Just involving the GenICam reference implementation, it offers consumers a way to dynamically configure/control the target devices.

The following diagram shows the hierarchy and relationship of the relevant modules:

############
Installation
############

In this section, we will learn how to instruct procedures to get Harvester work.

*******************
System Requirements
*******************

The following software modules are required to get Harvester working:

* Either of Python 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6

In addition, you will need the following items to let Harvester make something meaningful:

* GenTL Producers
* GenICam compliant machine vision cameras

***************************
Supported operating systems
***************************

Harvester has been tested with the following operating systems:

* macOS 10.13
* Ubuntu 14.04
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 7.4
* Windows 7

*************************
Installing Harvester Core
*************************

You can install Harvester via PyPI invoking the following command; note that the package name is ``harvesters`` but not ``harvester``; unfortunately, the latter word had been reserved:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install harvesters

For people who those have already installed it:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install --upgrade harvesters

Perhaps ``pip`` could install cached package. If you want to install the newly dowloaded package, you should invoke the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install harvesters --no-cache-dir

These commands will automatically install the required modules such as ``numpy`` or ``genicam2`` (the Python Binding for the GenICam GenApi & the GenTL Producers) if the module has not yet installed on your environment.

Getting back to the original topic, you could install the latest development version it using ``setup.py`` cloning Harvester from GitHub:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ git clone https://github.com/genicam/harvesters.git && cd harvesters && python setup.py install

************************
Installing Harvester GUI
************************

If you want to use Harvester GUI, then please additionally install the following modules. Note that ``PyQt`` is provided under LGPL and it may not be ideal for your purpose:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install PyQt5 vispy

In the future, we might support other GUI frameworks which are more or less open and free.

***********************
Launching Harvester GUI
***********************

To launch Harvester GUI, let's create a Python script file, naming ``harvester.py``, that contains the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication
    from harvesters.frontend.pyqt5 import Harvester

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app = QApplication(sys.argv)
        h = Harvester()
        h.show()
        sys.exit(app.exec_())

Then launch ``harvester.py``:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ python path/to/harvester.py

You will see Harvester GUI pops up.

###########################
How does Harvester help us?
###########################

Harvester mainly consists of the following two Python modules:

* **Harvester Core**: An image acquisition engine
* **Harvester GUI**: Graphical user interface between users & Harvester Core

In this section, we will learn what Harvester offers us through these components.

**************
Harvester Core
**************

Harvester Core is an image acquisition engine. No GUI. You can use it as an image acquisition library which acquires images from GenTL Producers through the GenTL-Python Binding and controls the target device (it's typically a camera) through the GenApi-Python Binding.

Harvester Core works as a minimalistic front-end for image acquisition. Just importing it from your Python script, you should immediately be able to set images on your table.

You'll be able to download the these language binding runtime libraries from the `EMVA website <https://www.emva.org/standards-technology/genicam/genicam-downloads/>`_, however, it's not available as of May 2018, because they have not officially released yet. Fortunately they are in the final reviewing process so hopefully they'll be released by the end of 2018.

If you don't have to care about the display rate for visualizing acquired images, the combination of Harvester Core and `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_ might be a realistic option for that purpose.

Tasks Harvester Core does for you
=================================

The main features of Harvester Core are listed as follows:

* Image acquisition through GenTL Producers
* Multiple loading of GenTL Producers in a single Python script
* GenICam feature node manipulation of the target device

Note that the second item implies you can involve multiple types of transport layers in your Python script. Each transport layer has own advantages and disadvantages and you should choose appropriate transport layers following your application's requirement. You just need to acquire images for some purposes and the GenTL Producers deliver the images somehow. It truly is the great benefit of the GenTL Standard! And of course, not only GenTL Producers but Harvester Core offer you a way to manipulate multiple devices in a single Python script with an intuitive manner.

On the other hand, Harvester Core could be considered as a simplified version of the GenTL-Python Binding; actually, Harvester Core hides it in its back and shows only intuitive interfaces to its clients. Harvester Core just offers you a relationship between you and a device. Nothing more. We say it again, just you and a device. If you need to manipulate more relevant GenTL modules or have to achieve something over a hardcore way, then you should directly work with the GenTL-Python Binding.

Pixel formats that Harvester Core supports
==========================================

Currently, Harvester Core supports the following pixel formats that are defined by the Pixel Format Naming Convention:

    ``Mono8``, ``Mono10``, ``Mono12``, ``Mono16``, ``RGB8``, ``RGBa8``, ``BayerRG8``, ``BayerGR8``, ``BayerBG8``, ``BayerGB8``, ``BayerRG16``, ``BayerGR16``, ``BayerBG16``, ``BayerGB16``

*************
Harvester GUI
*************

Harvester GUI works on the top of Harvester Core and offers you high-performance image data visualization on the fly. It involves VisPy for controlling OpenGL functionality and PyQt for providing GUI.

Tasks Harvester GUI does for you
================================

The main features of Harvester GUI are listed as follows:

* Image data visualization of the acquired images
* Image magnification using a mouse wheel or a trackpad
* Image dragging using a mouse or a trackpad
* An arbitrary selection of image displaying point in the data path (Not implemented yet)

Unlike Harvester Core, Harvester GUI limits the number of GenTL Producers to load just one. This is just a limitation to not make the GUI complicated. In general, the user should know which GenTL Producer should be loaded to control his target device. It's not necessary to load multiple GenTL Producers for this use case. However, this is just an idea in an early stage. We might support multiple loading on even Harvester GUI in the future.

Pixel formats that Harvester GUI supports
=========================================

Currently, Harvester GUI supports the following pixel formats that are defined by the Pixel Format Naming Convention:

    ``Mono8``, ``Mono10``, ``Mono12``, ``Mono16``, ``RGB8``, ``RGBa8``, ``BayerRG8``, ``BayerGR8``, ``BayerBG8``, ``BayerGB8``, ``BayerRG16``, ``BayerGR16``, ``BayerBG16``, ``BayerGB16``

Note that Harvester GUI has not yet supported demosaicing.

Screenshots
###########

In this section, we see some useful windows which Harvester offers you.

****************************
Image data visualizer window
****************************

The image data visualizer window (below) offers you a visualization of the acquired images. In this screenshot, Harvester is acquiring a 4000 x 3000 pixel of RGB8 image at 30 fps; it means it's acquiring images at 8.6 Gbps. It's quite fast, isn't it?

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8652625/43035346-c84fe404-8d28-11e8-815f-2df66cbbc6d0.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Image data visualizer

***************************
Attribute controller window
***************************

The attribute controller window (below) offers you to manipulate GenICam feature nodes of the target device. Changing exposure time, triggering the target device for image acquisition, storing a set of camera configuration so-called User Set, etc, you can manually control the target device anytime when you want to. It supports the visibility filter feature and regular expression feature. These features are useful in a case where you need to display only the features you are interested in.

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8652625/43035351-d35a2936-8d28-11e8-83d5-7b6efa6e2ad8.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Attribute Controller

*************************
Harvester Core on IPython
*************************

The following screenshot shows Harvester Core is running on IPython. Harvester Core returns the latest image data at the moment as a Numpy array every time its user call the ``get_image()`` method. Once you get an image you should be able to immediately start image processing. If you're running on the Jupyter notebook, you should be able to visualize the image data using Matplotlib. This step should be helpful to check what's going on your trial in the image processing flow.

Using Harvester
###############

********************
Using Harvester Core
********************

First, let's import Harvester:

.. code-block:: python

    from harvesters.core import Harvester

Then instantiate a Harvester object; we're going to use ``h`` that stands for
Harvester as its identifier.

.. code-block:: python

    h = Harvester()

And load a CTI file; loading a CTI file, you can communicate with the GenTL
Producer:

.. code-block:: python

    h.add_cti_file('path/to/gentl_producer.cti')

Note that you can add **one or more CTI files** on a single Harvester Core object. To add another CTI file, just repeat calling ``add_cti_file`` method passing another target CTI file:

.. code-block:: python

    h.add_cti_file('path/to/another_gentl_producer.cti')

And the following code will let you know the CTI files that have been loaded
on the Harvester object:

.. code-block:: python

    h.cti_files

In a contrary sense, you can remove a specific CTI file that you have added with the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    h.remove_cti_file('path/to/gentl_producer.cti')

And now yol have to update the list of devices; it fills up your device
information list and you'll select a device to control from the list:

.. code-block:: python

    h.update_device_info_list()

The following code will let you know the devices that you can control:

.. code-block:: python

    h.device_info_list

Our friendly GenTL Producer, so called TLSimu, gives you the following information:

.. code-block:: python

    [(unique_id='TLSimuMono', vendor='EMVA_D', model='TLSimuMono', tl_type='Custom', user_defined_name='Center', serial_number='SN_InterfaceA_0', version='1.2.3'),
     (unique_id='TLSimuColor', vendor='EMVA_D', model='TLSimuColor', tl_type='Custom', user_defined_name='Center', serial_number='SN_InterfaceA_1', version='1.2.3'),
     (unique_id='TLSimuMono', vendor='EMVA_D', model='TLSimuMono', tl_type='Custom', user_defined_name='Center', serial_number='SN_InterfaceB_0', version='1.2.3'),
     (unique_id='TLSimuColor', vendor='EMVA_D', model='TLSimuColor', tl_type='Custom', user_defined_name='Center', serial_number='SN_InterfaceB_1', version='1.2.3')]

And you create an image acquisition manager object specifying a target device. The image acquisition manager does the image acquisition task for you. In the following example it's trying to create an manager object of the first candidate device in the device information list:

.. code-block:: python

    iam = h.create_image_acquisition_manager(0)

Or equivalently:

.. code-block:: python

    iam = h.create_image_acquisition_manager(list_index=0)

You can connect the same device passing more unique information to the method such as:

.. code-block:: python

    mono_a = h.create_image_acquisition_manager(serial_number='SN_InterfaceA_0')

We named the manager object ``iam`` in the above example but in a practical occasion, you may name it like just ``camera``, ``mono_cam``, or ``face_detection_cam`` more specifically even though those entities don't acquire images by themselves but they transfer images that will be acquired by their image acquisition manager.

Anyway, then now we start image acquisition:

.. code-block:: python

    iam.start_image_acquisition()

Once you started image acquisition, you should definitely want to get an image. An image is delivered to a buffer manager object. To fetch a buffer that has been filled up with an image, you can have 2 options; the first option is to use the ``with`` statement:

.. code-block:: python

    with iam.fetch_buffer() as buffer:
        # Work with the Buffer object. It consists of everything you need.
        print(buffer)
        # The buffer will automatically be queued.

Having that code, the fetched buffer is automatically queued once the code step out from the scope of the ``with`` statement. It's prevents you to forget queueing it by accident. The other option is to manually queue the fetched buffer by yourself:

.. code-block:: python

    buffer = iam.fetch_buffer()
    print(buffer)
    # Don't forget to queue the buffer.
    buffer.queue()

In this option, again, please do not forget that you have to queue the buffer by yourself. If you forget queueing it, then you'll lose a buffer that could be used for image acquisition. Everything is up to your design, so please choose an appropriate way for you. In addition, once you queued the buffer, the Buffer object will be obsolete. There's nothing to do with it.

Okay, then you would stop image acquisition with the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    iam.stop_image_acquisition()

And the following code disconnects the connecting device from the image acquisition manager; you'll have to create an image acquisition manager object again when you have to work with a device:

.. code-block:: python

    iam.destroy()

Now you can quit the program! Please not that the image acquisition manager also supports the ``with`` statement. So you may write program as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    with h.create_image_acquisition_manager(0) as iam:
        # Work, work, and work with the iam object.

    # the iam object will automatically call the destroy method.

The initial idea about Harvester suddenly came up to a software engineer, Kazunari Kudo's head in the early April of year 2018 and he immediately decided to bring the first prototype to the International Vision Standards Meeting, IVSM in short, that was going to be held in Frankfurt am Main in the following early May. During the Frankfurt IVSM, interested engineers tried out Harvester and confirmed it really worked using commercial machine vision cameras provided by well-known machine vision camera manufacturers in the world. Having that fact, the attendees of the IVSM warmly welcomed Harvester.

The following individuals have directly or indirectly contributed to the development activity of Harvester or encouraged the developers by their thoughtful warm words; they are our respectable wonderful colleagues:
